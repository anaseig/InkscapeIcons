**DISCLAIMER**
<br />
this is an opensource project to make a better icon design system for inkscape. i do not own all the work, rather i assembled many of the icons from awesome contributors like - logos by nick and 7kv929, as well as i designed some of them. yet there's a lot to do to make it complete.
you can also contribute to this project by making minimal icons (as many quantities as you want).
